# getting started with Robust, in Excel
After installing LSU, first thing is to select the right Robust server:

The server probably requires authentication:

Enter your credentials, joined by a `:`, like this: `username:password`.

It's also a good idea to update template data, unless you only want to run requests on existing excel files:

 Note: unfortunately, it's not persistent yet, so you'll need to do it again if you close Excel.

Yay!

Finally, we can load an example:

 This one contains a medium-sized set of example bank statements and some other data.


Now it's time to ask the server to process it:

Excel will wait a while and then give up, because this example keeps the server busy for anywhere between 3 and 10 minutes. But this is not a problem.

 Wait a few minutes and hit F5 until `completed` appears. There will eventually be a way to manage long-running requests better :-)

 This is a directory where all reports, as well as various machine-readable files, are saved. You should always check the alerts file. If any issues were detected, they will be noted here. In this case, it says `no alerts.`, so we move on.

Good.

Back in Excel, we can now load any result sheets produced:

This is the excel version of the investment report, that you can also find among the html files. Nice!
